The dual consistency is an important issue in developing stable DWR er- ror estimation towards the goal-oriented mesh adaptivity. In this paper, such an issue is studied in depth based on a Newton-GMG framework for the steady Euler equa- tions. Theoretically, the numerical framework is redescribed using the Petrov-Galerkin scheme, based on which the dual consistency is depicted. It is found that for a prob- lem with general configuration, a boundary modification technique is an effective ap- proach to preserve the dual consistency in our numerical framework. Numerically, a geometrical multigrid is proposed for solving the dual problem, and a regulariza- tion term is designed to guarantee the convergence of the iteration. The following features of our method can be observed from numerical experiments, i). a stable nu- merical convergence of the quantity of interest can be obtained smoothly for problems with different configurations, and ii). towards accurate calculation of quantity of in- terest, mesh grids can be saved significantly using the proposed dual-consistent DWR method, compared with the dual-inconsistent one.
