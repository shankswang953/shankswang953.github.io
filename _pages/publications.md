1. A mechanism-informed reinforcement learning framework for shape optimization of airfoils [link](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.04329)

   In this study, we present the mechanism-informed reinforcement learning framework for airfoil shape optimization. By leveraging the twin delayed deep deterministic policy gradient algorithm for its notable stability, our approach addresses the complexities of optimizing shapes governed by fluid dynamics.
2. Your Second Publication Title [link](https://link-to-your-second-paper.com)

   Description or abstract of your second publication.
