My research has primarily focused on numerical solutions of partial differential equations. More specifically, I mainly use the finite volume method and focus on compressible fluids. One of my major interests is developing mesh adaptation methods to meet various computational demands. During my Ph.D. study, I started research in adjoint-based mesh adaptation, wherein I developed a dual consistent automatic mesh adaptation method based on the steady Euler equations within the AFVM4CFD, a library maintained by our group.
Additionally, I believe machine learning is a competitive technique in numerical calculation. I prefer to integrate machine learning with classical methods instead of substituting them. For example, I use the convolutional neural network to enhance the mesh adaptation but remain the solver for the governing equations. Currently, I am exploring reinforcement learning for optimization and trying to enhance such a process by classical method-informed learning frameworks. For example, the shape optimization of airfoil based on the CFD model and geometrical optimization of a molecule based on the DFT model.
