My research interests span across numerical methods for partial differential equations (PDEs), machine learning, and optimization.

**Numerical Methods in PDEs**

A key focus of my research is the development of mesh adaptation methods designed to fulfill a variety of computational needs. During my Ph.D. studies, I embarked on research into adjoint-based mesh adaptation. Here, I innovated a dual consistent automatic mesh adaptation method predicated on the steady Euler equations within AFVM4CFD, a library our group maintains. Furthermore, I introduced a hybrid approach combining Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) and a Dual solver to expedite the mesh adaptation process.

**Machine learning in PDE fields**

I view machine learning as a potent adjunct to numerical computation, preferring to amalgamate it with traditional methodologies rather than replace them. Presently, my research ventures into utilizing reinforcement learning for optimization, with an emphasis on augmenting such processes through classical method-informed learning frameworks. Notably, my projects include airfoil shape optimization leveraging CFD models and molecular geometrical optimization informed by DFT models.
